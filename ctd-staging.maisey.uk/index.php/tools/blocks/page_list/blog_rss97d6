This is part of continued efforts to encourage sustainable approaches to retail entrances and ongoing support of the Close The Door campaign.</span></p>
<p>The event is aimed at discussing the harmful effects of open doors in retail environments and investigate how possible design alternatives, such as automated entrances, could help retailers keep doors closed when not in use, as well as discussing the challenges in taking these approaches.</p>
<p>The event is being organised in collaboration with ABC&amp;D Magazine. Representatives from both Marks and Spencer and John Lewis Partnership, as well as from key design consultants, ARUP Associates will be joining GEZE UK and Close The Door around the table on the day.</p>

				  <title>Crucial IOSH regulation</title>
				  <link>

				  <description><![CDATA[
					<p>An <a href="http://bit.ly/1R1kels" target="_blank">IOSH regulation</a> has come to light, stating :</p>
<p><span>'By law, employers should assess the risk of people being affected by diesel fumes, and then work to either stop exposure or reduce it with suitable control measures'</span></p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1HXeg0y" target="_blank">Kings College London/Imperial research</a> shows that levels of three of the most hazardous pollutants in diesel fumes are reduced  by a significant one third when the shop door to the street is closed. Therefore an open door policy in areas with high levels of air pollution (found right across UK towns and cities and largely resulting from diesel combustion) appears to be in contravention of this regulation.</p>
<p><span>This is very important in the light of upwards of 30,000 UK annual deaths from air pollution. Contrasted with 1,700 deaths on the road. Those worst affected work on or near the street. Shop workers are in a most unenviable position, being largely low paid, fluid in the workforce and without much voice against outdated and inhumane policies such as a Head Office Open Door edict.</span></p>
<p><span>Many thousands of UK shops of all types and sizes already trade successfully with the door closed. Many thousands more do not; these are almost exclusively chain stores with an open door policy from Head Office.</span></p>
<p><span>With thanks to Matt Keen for unearthing the regulation.</span></p>				  ]]></description>

				  <title>Fitzrovia Project starts</title>

					<p><span><br /><img style="float: right; margin: 15px;" src="/files/2214/5262/7836/d66cc3c377d746358eb162c0558a9baf.jpg" alt="TFP_BID_Logo_WarmRed.jpg" width="152" height="100" />Close the Door started a project with the retailers around the Tottenham Court Road with the Fitzrovia BID today. On a cold, damp day there was the expected mix of open and closed shop doors. Very friendly staff. Some complained of cold when the door was open, noise on the street and a Head Office Open Door policy. Some managers ignored a company open door policy on their own initiative. Almost none had heard about the very high levels of air pollution on the Tottenham Court Road (over twice the EU limit and </span>amongst the highest in London), what it means for their health, or that closing the door greatly improves air quality inside. </p>
<p>With many thanks to The Fitzrovia Partnership BID for their support and help. </p>				  ]]></description>

				  <title>GEZE becomes official supporter of Close the Door</title>

					<p><strong>The <a href="http://www.geze.co.uk/geze/company/news/pressarticle/article/geze-uk-spon-2.html" target="_blank">Close The Door</a> campaign has named GEZE UK, which manufactures door and window control systems, as the exclusive sponsor representing the automatic door industry.</strong><img style="float: right;" src="/files/8314/5225/5863/Close_the_Door.jpg" alt="Close_the_Door.jpg" width="250" height="167" /></p>
<p>GEZE is the only door control company to support the campaign,</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be supporting the Close The Door campaign,” said Kaz Spiewakowski, managing director at GEZE UK, “it’s premise is very simple, but the results can make a huge difference to the environment, staff and customers and of course, a retailers’ energy spend.</p>
<p>“Sustainability is a big issue to our customers and we spend a lot of time designing energy efficient solutions such as lobbies, but this is wasted if doors are then propped open allowing heated or cooled air to escape. We are encouraging architects and specifiers to use automatic doors as part of their retail designs. Unidirectional radar sensors can be used to ensure automatic doors only open when a user approaches, closing again when they depart, reducing 'hold open' time by 40 per cent - and of course, automatic doors also enable accessibility.”</p>
<p>Jeannie Dawkins said: “The aim of the business friendly Close the Door initiative is to make it common practice to close the shop door when using energy to heat or cool the store, or when air pollution levels are raised on the street outside. Despite the many shops that do this, tens of thousands still do not comply. I greatly welcome GEZE’s support and input for the campaign. </p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">“Ahead of the coming winter the National Grid has declared a mere 1.5% spare capacity, barely enough to cover a mild to medium season. Energy has fast become precious and we cannot afford to waste it by blowing it out of thousands of open shop doors in the form of heat.</span></p>
<p>“Air pollution, largely from diesel vehicles, is a major health problem across all UK towns and cities. Closing the door creates a one third drop in air pollution in store. Keeping the door to the street closed is a simple way to prevent energy waste and air pollution and has great benefits for retailers, staff and the community they serve. There is no downside. It is vital to ethical trading.</p>
