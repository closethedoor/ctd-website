<p>“In many of the UK’s towns and cities we still face levels of air pollution that carry serious health risks, both in the short and long term. Work carried out by King’s College London and Imperial College London in shops on Regent Street showed a clear one third drop in PM<sub>2.5 </sub>and black carbon particulates simply by closing the door during working hours. NO<sub>2</sub> was similarly cut. Closing the shop doors facing polluted streets affords a significant reduction in risk not only to customers, but also to staff who have to work in the space all day. It is simple common sense.<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>
<p>While we work on resolving the wider issue of air pollution, it is important that people at most risk are made aware, and that simple measures to reduce their exposure are made available to them. This may be by taking a less polluted travel route, ventilating houses near busy roads by opening windows only at the back, or closing the shop door on to busy streets.<strong>”</strong></p>		</div>

<p>"I am delighted that this initiative represents one of many good and innovative ideas coming out of the region I represent. It is absolutely critical that we all pay attention to reducing energy use and emissions. Retailers who keep their doors open while heating or cooling the store are wasting significant amounts of energy. Whether retailers or customers, we can stop this by simply closing the shop door. It is that easy. Excuses based on tempting customers into shops through open doors are not acceptable or sensible in this time of global warming and fuel crisis. The campaign started in Cambridge which now has over 250 stores of all sizes keeping the door closed, and other cities are following. Keeping the door closed against energy waste clearly need not cause retail hardship. Please join me in supporting the Close the Door campaign."</p>		</div>

			<h3>Liberal Democrat environment spokesman in the European Parliament</h3>
<p>"I wholeheartedly support the Close the Door campaign and the work it is doing to persuade retailers to close their doors against energy waste. Estimates suggest that shops waste around £300 million each year because their doors are left open. Many could slash their energy bills by 20-25% if they closed them. The excess use of energy is also contributing to climate change but could be solved by simply shutting the door and keeping the heat or air conditioning in. I have heard both shop staff and customers complaining on windy days about icy air whistling in through open doors. The policy is madness and I hope retailers will wake up to the waste.</p>
<p>Open doors are intended to entice customers to step inside. But with the United Nations predicting that billions will suffer from the effects of global warming it is morally indefensible to waste energy in this way."</p>		</div>

Closing the door, just as we all do at home when using heating or air conditioning, is easy and effective. Several hundreds of shops in Cambridge alone already now follow this practice without any adverse effect on profit. Indeed they are saving on their energy bills.</p>

I hope this will encourage the retail sector and customers alike to act responsibly in keeping doors closed while energy is being used to heat/cool a store. Preventing energy waste is critical to us all, and this is an easy and effective step at very little inconvenience. Please support those shops which close their doors to conserve energy."</p>		</div>

			<h3>MP (Con) for Guildford, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Public Health), Health</h3>
<p>"This is a fantastic idea to make a real difference to excess energy consumption, whilst also having an impact on climate change. It is terrible to walk down a high street and see shops with their doors open, particularly during this freezing weather, with warm air and energy pouring out. Well done to the women whose idea this was. It just goes to show that everyone can make a difference. I am certainly going to do all I can as a constituency MP to encourage all of the shops in my patch to close their doors.</p>
<p>Not all local shop managers have discretion on whether the doors area open or not, and not all local shops have doors that are capable of opening and shutting as each customer comes through. Some shops have already shut their doors and I am writing to the head offices of a number of the retailers in Guildford to raise this issue with them. I have also written to Guildford Borough Council to see if there is any pressure they can bring. Times are tough for shops, but acting responsibly is what people want to see. If anyone wants to let me know of shops that keep their doors open do drop me an email.”</p>		</div>

Energy efficiency is a great challenge for everyone and I am delighted to help raise awareness of such an elegant solution to the problem. Closing the door of heated or air conditioned shops makes a significant difference to energy use at the heart of the community. What’s more, by taking this easy step, businesses can expect further benefits such as reduced energy bills and a healthier in-store environment. Adopting Close the Door makes sense for us all, giving customers and retailers the chance to help business and make a real difference to the community.</span></span></p>		</div>

			<h3>MP (Lab) Cambridge</h3>
<p>As MP for Cambridge I am delighted to make supporting Close the Door one of my first actions.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Climate change is an urgent problem and yet sometimes it seems hard to know what local, individual actions we can take.</span></p>
<p>Backing Close the Door is one of those actions. It's so simple. closing the shop or restaurant door to the street when heating or cooling the premises or when air pollution levels are high on the street outside saves a large amount of energy (and money), and greatly improves the air quality inside the premises.</p>
<p>This in turn improves working conditions and public health.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that our local Cambridge initiative has grown from eight independent shops into an award winning national campaign backed by thousands of shops of all types and sizes including national retailers.</p>
<p>In actively supporting close the Door I encourage you to follow my lead.</p>		</div>

<p>"I support the Close the Door campaign, home grown in my constituency. Backed by excellent research, this is a very simple idea that really works, for business and the community. Close the door to the shop or restaurant and you can greatly improve air quality inside, currently a serious health concern across UK towns and cities.You can also save significant amounts of energy in heating/air conditioning otherwise disappearing out of the door to heat or cool the street. There are now thousands of shops across the country operating successfully like this. It is such common sense and benefits us all whether we shop in or staff these businesses."</p>		</div>
